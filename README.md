## About Me

Hey there! I'm Robby, a data detective who's always on the case. With over 5 years in the retail e-commerce scene, I've cracked more data mysteries than Sherlock Holmes has solved crimes (probably). I didn’t take the traditional route into tech—my path was more of a scenic detour with plenty of caffeine stops.

My curiosity for numbers led me to dive into the world of data science, where I’m now armed with a diploma from BrainStation. I’ve got skills in data analysis, machine learning, and creating visualizations that make complex data as easy to digest as a slice of pie (but remember, we don’t use pie charts here).

When I’m not turning data into insights, you’ll find me dreaming up new ways to automate the mundane. I’m on the lookout for a full-time gig where I can flex my analytical muscles and help solve real-world problems. If you’re looking for someone who’s as passionate about data as a cat is about a laser pointer, I’m your person.
